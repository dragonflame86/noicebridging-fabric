# No Ice Bridging
A minecraft mod preventing ice briding in the nether.

The purpose of this mod is to remove nether ice bridging and highways by making ice of all kinds melt when in the nether.

Now you may be asking: why?
The answers are simple.

1. It devalues alternative methods of transport, making boats reign supreme in a place with no water.
2. Why would ice exist in a world that can't even support liquid water.
3. What server owner doesn't want to troll their playerbase a little :)

Have fun!
